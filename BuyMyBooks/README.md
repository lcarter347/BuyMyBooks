Welcome to BuyMyBooks!

BuyMyBooks is a web app where students can sell their textbooks to other students.

In order to get the site up and running, you must do the following things:

1. Clone this repo into your workspace. 
2. Run BuyMyBooks/buymybooks.sql in order to set up the database.
3. Once the database is set up, you can test the site with one of the existing user accounts,
    or you can create one of your own.
    The credentials for the two existing accounts are:
    Email: lcarter@mail.com     Password: password
    Email: sholt@mail.com     Password: password
4. The current functionality of the website includes creating an account, logging in to an
    account, logging out of an account, and viewing your account information. Login status is
    maintained through sessions.
